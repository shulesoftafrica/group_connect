Alright — here’s your **Master AI Roadmap Prompt** for building **ShuleSoft Group Connect** in a structured, AI-friendly, step-by-step way.
This is designed so you can paste it into an AI tool (or use it with me) and have the AI **work through each stage in sequence** without losing the big picture.

## **Master AI Prompt – ShuleSoft Group Connect Development Roadmap**

> You are acting as a **senior product architect & full-stack development lead** tasked with building **ShuleSoft Group Connect**, a centralized platform for owners who manage multiple schools.
> Each school already uses ShuleSoft independently, but this platform will:
>
> 1. Aggregate data from 100+ schools into a **single dashboard** with drill-down into individual schools.
> 2. Allow **bulk actions** such as approving budgets, sending communications, and pushing standardized policies/settings to all schools.
> 3. Provide **AI-powered insights & alerts** to improve academic, operational, and financial performance across the group.
>
> You must follow the **7-stage roadmap** below. For each stage:
>
> * Produce detailed **technical specifications** (data models, APIs, security considerations).
> * Provide **UI/UX wireframes** (in Figma/HTML/CSS markup or equivalent).
> * Include **sample data outputs** (JSON/XML examples).
> * Suggest **testing steps** for validation before moving to the next stage.
> * Ensure that your outputs **connect seamlessly with previous stages**.
> * Follow modern best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 1 – Data Model & Aggregation API**
>
> * Design a **data model** that supports group-level aggregation and drill-down views.
> * Create **API endpoints** to pull real-time data from each school's ShuleSoft instance.
> * Ensure **secure authentication & access control** for group-level operations.
> * Deliverables: ER diagram, endpoint list, sample JSON payloads, data sync logic.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 2 – Core Dashboard & Navigation**
>
> * Build a **group-level dashboard** showing KPIs (students, fees, attendance, performance).
> * Implement **interactive map** of schools with hover stats.
> * Create a **top navigation menu** with: Dashboard, Schools Overview, Academics, Operations, Finance & Accounts, HR, Communications, Digital Learning, Settings, Reports.
> * Deliverables: UI wireframes, navigation component structure, dashboard mockup with API integration plan.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 3 – Academics & Operations Modules**
>
> * **Academics**: Aggregate performance metrics, pass rates, subject performance, drill-down to student level.
> * **Operations**: Aggregate attendance, transport usage, hostel occupancy, library usage.
> * Implement **bulk update actions** (grading policies, routines).
> * Deliverables: Database queries, API endpoints, frontend layouts for reports & controls.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 4 – Finance & HR Modules**
>
> * **Finance**: Aggregate fee collection, revenue/expenses, pending invoices, budget approvals.
> * **HR**: Aggregate staff data, payroll summaries, leave reports.
> * Enable **bulk approvals** and **policy updates** across schools.
> * Deliverables: Financial data flow diagrams, payroll integration plan, frontend wireframes.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 5 – Communications & Digital Learning**
>
> * **Communications**: Bulk SMS/Email/Letters to all or selected schools, group templates, campaign tracking.
> * **Digital Learning**: Aggregate e-learning usage, online exam stats, push learning content in bulk.
> * Deliverables: Messaging architecture, frontend UI, analytics dashboard.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 6 – Settings & Control Panel**
>
> * Create a centralized settings panel for academic years, grading rules, policies, and access control.
> * Implement **role-based access** (Owner, Regional Manager, Auditor).
> * Allow **instant push of configuration changes** to all schools.
> * Deliverables: Role-permission matrix, API specs, settings UI components.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Stage 7 – AI Insights & Alerts**
>
> * Implement AI for anomaly detection, performance predictions, and recommendations.
> * AI should send alerts for sudden drops in attendance, fee collection, or academic performance.
> * Deliverables: ML model outline, alert notification system, example AI recommendations.
>
> ---
>
> ### **Final Output**
>
> After completing Stage 7:
>
> 1. Compile all technical documentation into a single **system architecture report**.
> 2. Provide **deployment recommendations** (cloud architecture, database scaling, load balancing).
> 3. Suggest **future enhancements** for next versions.
>
> ---
>
> **Important Notes**
>
> * Use **consistent naming conventions** and design principles across all stages.
> * Assume integration with **existing ShuleSoft databases & APIs**.
> * Follow a **mobile-first responsive design** approach.
> * All API endpoints must be **RESTful** and **secure**.
> * Use **realistic sample data** for mockups.
>
> ---
>
> Now, start with **Stage 1** and wait for my confirmation before moving to Stage 2.

This way, you have **one master prompt** that contains the **entire scope** but still makes the AI **work in manageable, sequential stages** — so it never loses focus, but it also never overwhelms itself trying to do everything in one shot.

If you want, I can now **create Stage 1’s detailed output** for you, so you can see exactly how the process will start. That would mean we immediately begin building ShuleSoft Group Connect’s foundation.

Do you want me to kick off Stage 1 now?
