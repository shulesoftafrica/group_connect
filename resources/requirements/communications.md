# Communications Module – Owner & System User Perspective

As an **Owner** or any user with access to the Communications module in ShuleSoft Group Connect, the goal is to have a centralized, efficient, and flexible way to manage all communications across multiple schools. Here’s how the module should work to best support group-wide communication needs:

## 1. Centralized Messaging
- **general communication reports/statistics:** A list of KPI that let us know how many messages (sms, emails, whatsapp) have been sent by schools we manage to their parents.
- **Unified Interface:** A single dashboard to compose, send, and track messages (SMS, Email, Letters) to all or selected schools.
- **Bulk Messaging:** Ability to send announcements, policy updates, or urgent alerts to all schools, specific roles in a school, or custom groups but not directly to parents.

## 2. Targeted Communication

- **Audience Selection:** Easily filter and select recipients by school principle (in setting table), school roles (in shulesoft.roles e.g., Principals, Teachers), or custom lists.
- **Personalization:** Merge fields (school name, recipient name) for personalized messages at scale.

## 3. Campaign Management & Tracking

- **Campaign Creation:** Launch communication campaigns (e.g., awareness drives, surveys) and track their progress.
- **Delivery Tracking:** Real-time status of sent messages (delivered, failed, opened).
- **Engagement Analytics:** View feedback and response rates from schools and users.

## 4. Feedback & Aggregation

- **Feedback Collection:** Allow recipients to respond or acknowledge messages, with responses aggregated for group-level review.
- **Summary Reports:** Downloadable reports on communication effectiveness, engagement, and outstanding responses.

## 5. Alerts & Automation

- **Automated Alerts:** Set up scheduled or trigger-based messages (e.g., reminders for deadlines, compliance alerts).
- **Notification Rules:** Define who receives which alerts and under what conditions.

## 6. Integration & Accessibility

- **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing ShuleSoft school accounts for up-to-date contact lists.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions to ensure only authorized users can send or view group communications.
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Responsive design for managing communications on any device.

## 7. Quick Actions

- **One-Click Actions:** Approve, resend, or escalate messages directly from the dashboard.
- **Bulk Actions:** Schedule or repeat messages for recurring events or reminders.

**Summary:**  
The Communications module should empower owners and authorized users to efficiently coordinate, monitor, and analyze all group-wide communications, ensuring timely information flow and high engagement across all managed schools.
