during onboarding, user can select 3 options

1. all schools use ShuleSoft already, so he will be supposed to enter login code
2. some use shulesoft, and others dont use shulesoft
3. none use shulesoft

The challenge now is, if owner choose some use ShuleSoft,and enter school details, those details supplied are not saved anywhere

Another challenge is, even if user selects that non of schools use shulesoft, he can still login, with completely no school, and still explore the entire platform

another concern is, there is no clear instruction sent to those schools who are not using shulesoft but registered here, to guide these schools on what to do, and why they have received such an email
